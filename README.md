## 🔆 Introduction
Official implementation of HiFi-123: Towards High-fidelity One Image to 3D Content Generation, we are working hard on cleaning the code, please stay tuned.

## ⚙️ Setup
Our code will be integrated into threestudio to combine with a variety of models implemented by threestudio, making our method a generalized tool for enhancing texture quality in Image-to-3D generation.
